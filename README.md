# Vacuum Robot

'Bot545046.py' contains my code for a vacuum robot, which is tasked with cleaning a known amount of stains, in a variety of unknown maps with various obstacles. The robot uses the [A* pathfinding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) to find the fastest route towards an observed stain, or towards unexplored territory. This algorithm inherently finds an efficient path around obstacles.

I submitted this code in May 2023, during my premaster Data Science and Society at Tilburg University, and received a 10, and an award for the best submission of the class. The other files in this repository are from the creator of the assignment of the Tilburg University course Programming & Algorithmic Thinking, taught in the spring of 2023 by Dr. Paris Mavromoustakos Blom.

Below is a visual demo of the robot.
