'Bot545046.py' contains my code for a vacuum robot, which is tasked with cleaning a known amount of stains, in a variety of unknown maps with various obstacles.

I submitted this code in May 2023, for an assignment from my Premaster Data Science and Society at Tilburg University. The other files in this repository are from this assignment, and are not my creation.

Below is a visual demo of the robot.
